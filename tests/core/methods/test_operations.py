"""Tests for basic quantum operations on Matrix Product States (MPS).

This module contains tests verifying fundamental operations on Matrix Product States (MPS)
implemented in YAQS. Specifically, it tests:

- Scalar products between MPS, including cases of identical states, orthogonal states,
  and partial scalar products at specified sites.
- Calculation of local expectation values for common quantum observables (Pauli X and Z)
  on standard quantum states (|0>, |1>, |+>).
- Quantum measurements (single-shot and multi-shot) on MPS representations of simple product states.

These tests ensure correctness and reliability of basic quantum operations within YAQS.
