"""Library of noise processes.

This module defines noise operator classes for quantum systems.
It includes implementations for excitation, relaxation, and dephasing noise operators,
each represented as a 2x2 numpy array. The module also provides a NoiseLibrary class
that aggregates these noise operators for convenient access. Future improvements
may extend these implementations to d-level systems.
