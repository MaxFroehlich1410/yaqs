"""Noise Models.

This module defines the NoiseModel class, which represents a noise model in a quantum system.
It stores a list of noise processes and their corresponding strengths, and automatically retrieves
the associated jump operator matrices from the NoiseLibrary. These jump operators are used to simulate
the effects of noise in quantum simulations.
